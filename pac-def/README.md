# Peripheral Access Crate Definitions

This folder contains the definitions of the peripheral access crate (PAC) for the Zynq-7000 series of SoCs. The PAC is generated using the RustPACGen tool. The RustPACGen tool is a custom tool that generates the PAC from JSON files that describe the definitions of the peripherals in the SoC.
